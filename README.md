# Online-Retail-data-and-Customer-data-Analysis

In this project, we ingest and clean a large online retail transaction dataset and perform sales, product, customer, and geographical analysis using SQL. By transforming raw transactional data into analytics-ready tables, we uncover revenue trends, customer behavior patterns, and product performance insights that can support business decision-making such as inventory planning, customer segmentation, and regional strategy.
